"""
Fine-tune YOLOv11x drone detection model on your custom 3D-printed drone photos.

Before running:
1. pip install ultralytics
2. Label your My_Custom_Prints images on roboflow.com (class name: drone)
3. Export as YOLOv8 format and unzip into: Drone/dataset/
4. The dataset/ folder should have: data.yaml, train/, valid/ subfolders

Then run: python train_finetune.py
